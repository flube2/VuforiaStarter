**Built, but not tested, for Windows**

***Currently, this app is intended for Android only.***

* If you would only like to install the Android app, please navigate to Builds/Android and download the .apk file.
* If you would like to try the experimental Windows (7) build, please download the Builds/Windows folder and run the .exe.
* If you would like to mess with the source code for some strange reason, feel free to do so as long as you cite all of my sources and I.

The following is in reference to Android 7. It *should* work for all Android phones but I can't guarentee anything.

Possible Precursors:
Navigate to Settings --> Security --> Unknown Sources and make sure this is checked/turned on.

*As far as I'm aware, this app does not need any special permissions upon installation*

To Use:
  * Download .apk file onto an Android phone and save in directory X.
  * Navigate to directory X via a File Manager and execute .apk to install.
  * Print image targets from the PrintMe directory.
  * Ensure app is launched and image targets have been printed clearly.
  * Point phone at printed image targets, 3D Augmented Reality models should appear.
